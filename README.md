# Kontener na spotkania

*Kontener na spotkania* (name is in polish, english counterpart: Container for meetings) it is a [meetup's](https://meetup.com) group that you can find here: https://www.meetup.com/kontener/. Its goal is to popularize the [containerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) ideas and create a simple platform to allow enthusiasts to exchange their knowledge and experience :)
